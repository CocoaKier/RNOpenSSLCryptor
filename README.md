This is an RNCryptor-style API in front of an OpenSSL-compatible encryption
format. I don't recommend the OpenSSL format. It has several security problems
that the [RNCryptor](https://github.com/RNCryptor/RNCryptor) format was designed
to improve on. This used to be part of RNCryptor respository. I don't support
this module anymore, but I know some people are using it, so I'm making it
available here.
